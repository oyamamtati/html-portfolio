<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 25 year old black woman from Gqeberha, South Africa who loves advocating for the most vulnerable.
   This is something I grew up with which influenced my decision on studying towards a social work degree from the
   Nelson Mandela University.
</p>

<p>I enjoy doing wholesome things like hiking, going to the beach most times not to swim but just to watch the waves, going out on dates
  letting loose and just playing.
